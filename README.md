# MantisBT-Plugin-ClosedDate

Currently in Mantis, there is no field for 'Closed Date' of a ticket, for when a ticket's status is marked as 'closed'. Using the bug_history_table in the database Mantis is running on, we can find when a ticket's status was marked as 'Closed' (status = 90) and the date modified for that status change. This script also makes sure date_closed is only filled when the current status is also 'closed', so re-opened tickets do not show a value. If a ticket is closed more than once, the script will take the most recent closed date. This plugin will create a column that you can add in View Issues, reports, etc. that will show the value.
